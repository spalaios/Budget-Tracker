Budget Tracker is a fully functional budget tracking application where a user can keep his regular expenses in check.
HTML,CSS and vanilla JavaScript was used to develop this application.This is my first application based on the MVC pattern

Key Learnings:

1. MVC pattern - creating seperate major module under which small modules would created
2. Module pattern - this helped in writing independent modules for application 
3. Usage of basic data structure to store various information efficiently
4. Planning and architecture of application before starting with coding section
